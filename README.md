Auxiliary functions and methods for Data Analysis &amp; Treatment in Python 2.X version.

This repositoy has the purpose of compiling different functions and methods I have developed for data analysis and treatment in Python 2.X version, most of them without the use of any non-base library (such as not using Pandas, numpy, etc).

So here you can find pure Python 2.X code.
